# Professional AI Trading Strategy - Tekoa Trading

## Overview

Tekoa Trading's AI trading system is designed to replicate the decision-making process of experienced professional traders. Unlike simple algorithmic trading systems that follow rigid rules, our AI agents exhibit the nuanced judgment, risk awareness, and adaptive behavior that characterizes successful human traders.

## Core Trading Philosophy

### Professional Trader Mindset

Our AI agents are trained to think like seasoned traders with these characteristics:

1. **Risk-First Mentality**: Always consider what can go wrong before what can go right
2. **Patience and Discipline**: Wait for high-quality setups rather than forcing trades
3. **Adaptive Strategy**: Adjust approach based on market conditions and performance
4. **Emotional Intelligence**: Manage "psychological" aspects like confidence and fear
5. **Continuous Learning**: Improve decision-making based on past performance

## AI Agent Architecture

### Broker Integration Focus

**Initial Implementation**: Capital.com Integration

- All AI agents are initially optimized for Capital.com's market data and trading pairs
- Trading pairs loaded from `capital-trading-pairs.json` with Capital.com-specific metadata
- Agents trained on Capital.com's execution characteristics and market hours
- Risk management adapted to Capital.com's position sizing and margin requirements

**Future Extensibility**: Multi-Broker Support

- Abstract broker interfaces allow agents to adapt to different brokers
- Broker-specific optimization profiles for each agent
- Symbol mapping and normalization across different broker APIs
- Extensible architecture for adding new brokers without agent retraining

      maxRiskPerTrade,
      this.getMaxSizeForSymbol(tradeSetup.symbol)
    );

- **Strategy Performance**: Rotate between strategies based on performance
- **Market Adaptation**: Adjust parameters based on changing market conditions

## Multi-Timeframe Analysis Framework

### Timeframe Hierarchy

1. **Primary Timeframe**: Main trading timeframe (15m, 1h, 4h)
2. **Higher Timeframe**: Context and bias (4h, 1d, 1w)
3. **Lower Timeframe**: Precise entry and exit (1m, 5m, 15m)

### Confluence Requirements

```typescript
interface TimeframeConfluence {
  daily: TrendDirection; // Overall market bias
  fourHour: TrendDirection; // Medium-term trend
  oneHour: TrendDirection; // Short-term trend
  fifteenMin: TrendDirection; // Entry timeframe

  confluenceScore: number; // 0-100, higher is better
  overallBias: "BULLISH" | "BEARISH" | "NEUTRAL";
  confidence: number; // Confidence in the bias
}

const calculateConfluence = (timeframes: TimeframeAnalysis[]): number => {
  // Professional traders require multiple timeframe agreement
  const agreement = timeframes.filter((tf) => tf.trend === timeframes[0].trend).length;
  const conflictPenalty = timeframes.filter((tf) => tf.trend === "OPPOSITE").length * 20;

  return Math.max(0, (agreement / timeframes.length) * 100 - conflictPenalty);
};
```

## Adaptive Strategy Selection

### Market Regime-Based Strategy Selection

```typescript
enum MarketRegime {
  TRENDING_BULLISH = "trending_bullish",
  TRENDING_BEARISH = "trending_bearish",
  RANGING = "ranging",
  VOLATILE = "volatile",
  LOW_VOLATILITY = "low_volatility",
}

const getOptimalStrategy = (regime: MarketRegime, volatility: number): TradingStrategy => {
  switch (regime) {
    case MarketRegime.TRENDING_BULLISH:
      return volatility > 2.0 ? "momentum_breakout" : "trend_following";

    case MarketRegime.TRENDING_BEARISH:
      return volatility > 2.0 ? "short_momentum" : "bear_trend_following";

    case MarketRegime.RANGING:
      return volatility > 1.5 ? "mean_reversion_volatile" : "mean_reversion_stable";

    case MarketRegime.VOLATILE:
      return "volatility_breakout";

    case MarketRegime.LOW_VOLATILITY:
      return "range_trading";
  }
};
```

## Psychological Trading Simulation

### Trader Psychology States

```typescript
interface TradingPsychology {
  confidence: number; // 0-100 based on recent performance
  riskTolerance: number; // Adjusted based on drawdowns
  patience: number; // Willingness to wait for good setups
  discipline: number; // Ability to follow trading rules
  emotionalState: "CONFIDENT" | "CAUTIOUS" | "FEARFUL" | "GREEDY";
}

const adjustDecisionForPsychology = (decision: TradingDecision, psychology: TradingPsychology): TradingDecision => {
  // Professional traders are more conservative after losses
  if (psychology.confidence < 50) {
    decision.positionSize *= 0.5;
    decision.confidence *= 0.8;
  }

  // Increase position size after winning streak (but conservatively)
  if (psychology.confidence > 80) {
    decision.positionSize *= Math.min(1.5, 1 + (psychology.confidence - 80) / 100);
  }

  // Skip trades when emotional state is extreme
  if (psychology.emotionalState === "FEARFUL" && decision.confidence < 70) {
    decision.action = "HOLD";
    decision.reasoning += " [Skipped due to low confidence state]";
  }

  return decision;
};
```

## Continuous Learning and Improvement

### Performance Feedback Loop

```typescript
class PerformanceFeedback {
  async updateAgentPerformance(trade: CompletedTrade): Promise<void> {
    // Analyze what went right or wrong
    const analysis = await this.analyzeTrade(trade);

    // Update agent confidence based on outcomes
    await this.updateAgentConfidence(trade.agentDecision, trade.outcome);

    // Adjust parameters based on performance
    await this.adjustStrategyParameters(trade.strategy, analysis);

    // Learn from market regime performance
    await this.updateRegimePerformance(trade.marketRegime, trade.outcome);
  }

  private async adjustStrategyParameters(strategy: string, analysis: TradeAnalysis): Promise<void> {
    // Professional traders continuously refine their approach
    if (analysis.outcome === "WIN") {
      // Reinforce successful patterns
      this.reinforceSuccessfulPatterns(strategy, analysis.entryConditions);
    } else {
      // Learn from losses
      this.adjustForUnsuccessfulPatterns(strategy, analysis.failureReason);
    }
  }
}
```
