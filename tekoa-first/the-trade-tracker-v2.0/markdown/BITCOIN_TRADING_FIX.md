# Bitcoin Trading Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The BTC trading was failing with 401 authentication errors due to a bug in the broker factory service where it was trying to decrypt already-decrypted credentials.

## Root Cause

In `backend/services/broker-factory.service.ts` (lines 37-42), the service was:

1. Getting broker credentials with `getBrokerCredentialById()` (which already decrypts them)
2. Then trying to decrypt them again with a new service instance
3. This caused the credentials to become corrupted/invalid
4. Leading to 401 authentication errors in Capital.com API calls

## Fix Applied

✅ **Modified `backend/services/broker-factory.service.ts`**:

- Removed the redundant decryption step
- Use credentials directly from `getBrokerCredentialById()` since they're already decrypted
- Added validation to ensure credentials are in the correct format

## Key Changes

```typescript
// BEFORE (broken):
const credentialsService = new (brokerCredentialService as any).constructor();
decryptedCredentials = credentialsService.decryptCredentials(credential.credentials);

// AFTER (fixed):
const decryptedCredentials = credential.credentials;
```

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ **Confirmed broker credentials exist and are valid**:

   - Credential ID: `04c362ec-9aa9-40a7-9ae4-36860984fc33`
   - User ID: `f99c772b-aca6-4163-954d-e2fd3fece3aa`
   - Broker: `capital.com`
   - Status: Active
   - Contains all required fields (apiKey, identifier, password, isDemo)

2. ✅ **Credentials are properly formatted**:
   - Stored as plain object (not encrypted string)
   - All required Capital.com fields present
   - Demo mode enabled

## Expected Result

- Bot authentication should now work correctly
- Capital.com API calls should succeed with proper credentials
- BTC trading should resume (if symbol is available in demo mode)

## Additional Notes

- The authentication was working for some API calls (getting positions) but failing for others (market data)
- This suggests the credentials were partially corrupted by the double-decryption
- The fix should resolve all Capital.com API authentication issues

## Symbol Availability

If BTC trading still fails after this fix, it may be due to:

- Bitcoin not being available in Capital.com demo mode
- Different epic format required for crypto symbols
- Account restrictions on cryptocurrency trading

In that case, test with forex pairs like EUR/USD which are definitely available.

## Next Steps

1. Restart the backend service with the fix
2. Monitor bot logs for successful authentication
3. Test with both crypto and forex symbols
4. If crypto still fails, focus on forex/stock trading first
