Missing Backend Components:

Scheduled Job Runner
We need to implement a scheduler for periodic bot execution based on their timeframes
This would allow bots to automatically run at 1m, 5m, 1h intervals as specified

Real-time Data Feed Integration
Connection to broker API for real-time market data
WebSocket setup for live price feeds and chart updates

Order Management System
Currently, we have the structure but need concrete implementations for order tracking
Position management and scaling functionality

Chart Engine Integration Completion
While we've implemented the basic chart generation in the bot service, we need to finalize the connection between the chart engine and the analysis system

Test Coverage
Unit and integration tests for all services and endpoints
Mock broker API for testing trade execution without real orders

Enhanced Error Handling & Logging
More comprehensive error handling across all services
Structured logging system for production debugging

API Documentation
OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for the REST endpoints
tRPC procedure documentation

Deployment Pipeline
CI/CD setup for automated testing and deployment
Docker containerization for easier deployment
