# 📋 Enhanced Trade Logging System

This document explains the new structured logging system designed to make trade tracking much cleaner and more useful.

## 🎯 What Changed

**Before:** Verbose logs with AI prompts, JSON dumps, chart generation details, and debugging noise.

**After:** Clean, structured logs focused on trade lifecycle and decisions.

## 🔧 Configuration Options

Set these environment variables to control logging:

```bash
# Log Level (error, warn, info, debug)
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Show only trade-related events (filters out system noise)
TRADE_LOGS_ONLY=true

# Enable detailed debug logs for troubleshooting
ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGS=false
```
