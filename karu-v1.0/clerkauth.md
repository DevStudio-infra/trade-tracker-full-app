Since you’ve decided to use Clerk for your multi-tenant Next.js + Express web app with read-only users, I’ll provide a comprehensive explanation of how to implement your requirements using Clerk’s free plan. This will cover everything from setting up Clerk, configuring multi-tenancy with Organizations, managing read-only users, securing your Next.js frontend and Express backend, and testing on localhost. I’ll ensure the solution is simple, secure, and tailored to your needs, with artifacts for key code components.

Understanding Your Requirements
Your app has the following key features:

Multi-Tenancy: Each tenant (e.g., a company or organization) has isolated data, identified by a unique tenantId.
Primary User: The tenant’s main user (e.g., an admin) can create and manage data for their tenant and invite other users.
Internal Read-Only Users: The primary user can create additional users within their tenant who have read-only access to the tenant’s data (i.e., they can view but not modify data).
Authentication: Secure sign-in/sign-up for all users (primary and read-only), potentially with email/password and social logins.
Authorization: Enforce tenant isolation (users only access their tenant’s data) and role-based access (primary users have full access, read-only users are restricted to read operations).
Localhost Development: The solution must work seamlessly in a localhost development environment (e.g., Next.js on http://localhost:3000, Express on http://localhost:5000).
You’re using Clerk’s free plan, which supports up to 10,000 monthly active users (MAUs) and 100 monthly active organizations, sufficient for development and small-scale production.

Why Clerk is Ideal
Clerk is a managed authentication and user management platform that simplifies your use case with:

Organizations: Native support for multi-tenancy, allowing users to create and manage tenants (organizations) with isolated members and data.
Custom Roles and Permissions: Easy setup for admin (primary user) and read-only roles, with permissions like data:read and data:write.
Pre-Built UI: Components like <SignIn />, <OrganizationProfile />, and <OrganizationSwitcher /> reduce frontend development time.
Backend Integration: The @clerk/backend SDK secures Express APIs with JWT verification and role-based access.
Free Plan: Includes all necessary features for your use case (except SMS auth and custom domain branding).
Localhost Support: Works out of the box with localhost after minimal configuration.
Full Explanation and Implementation
1. Clerk Setup
Clerk’s free plan provides everything you need for multi-tenancy and read-only users. Here’s how to set it up:

Steps
Create a Clerk Account:
Sign up at Clerk.dev and create a new application in the Clerk Dashboard.
Choose Next.js as your frontend framework to get tailored setup instructions (though we’ll also cover Express).
Get API Keys:
In the Clerk Dashboard, go to API Keys and copy the Publishable Key and Secret Key.
The Publishable Key is used in the Next.js frontend (client-side).
The Secret Key is used in the Express backend (server-side).
Enable Organizations:
Go to Settings > Organizations in the Clerk Dashboard and enable Organizations.
This activates multi-tenancy features, allowing users to create and manage organizations (tenants).
Configure Roles and Permissions:
In the Clerk Dashboard, under Organizations > Roles, create two roles:
admin: For primary users with full access (e.g., create, read, update, delete data).
read-only: For internal users with restricted access (e.g., read data only).
Define permissions:
data:read: Allows reading tenant data (assigned to both admin and read-only).
data:write: Allows creating/updating/deleting tenant data (assigned to admin only).
These permissions will be checked in your Express backend to enforce access control.
Set Allowed Origins for Localhost:
Go to Settings > Domains and add http://localhost:3000 (your Next.js dev URL) to Allowed Origins.
This ensures Clerk accepts requests from your local development environment.
Configure Sign-In/Sign-Up URLs:
Under Settings > User & Authentication > Sign-in and Sign-up, set the redirect URLs to:
Sign-in: http://localhost:3000/sign-in
Sign-up: http://localhost:3000/sign-up
This ensures Clerk redirects users to the correct pages after authentication.
Enable Authentication Methods:
In Settings > User & Authentication > Sign-in, enable:
Email/Password: For standard login.
Social Logins: Enable Google, GitHub, or others as needed (configure OAuth credentials in the provider’s developer console).
Magic Links: Optional for passwordless email login (included in the free plan).
2. Next.js Frontend Setup
The Next.js frontend handles the user interface, including authentication flows, organization management, and data display. Clerk’s @clerk/nextjs package provides pre-built components and hooks to simplify this.

Steps
Install Clerk SDK:
In your Next.js project, install the Clerk Next.js package:
bash

npm install @clerk/nextjs
Set Environment Variables:
Create a .env.local file in your Next.js project root and add:
env

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
These variables configure Clerk’s frontend SDK and redirect URLs.
Wrap App with ClerkProvider:
Modify app/layout.jsx to include <ClerkProvider>:
jsx

import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
      <html lang="en">
        <body>{children}</body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
This enables Clerk’s authentication context across your app.
Create Sign-In and Sign-Up Pages:
Use Clerk’s pre-built <SignIn /> and <SignUp /> components.
Create app/sign-in/page.jsx:
jsx

import { SignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs';

export default function SignInPage() {
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', padding: '50px' }}>
      <SignIn />
    </div>
  );
}
Create app/sign-up/page.jsx:
jsx

import { SignUp } from '@clerk/nextjs';

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', padding: '50px' }}>
      <SignUp />
    </div>
  );
}
Create Dashboard Page:
The dashboard allows primary users to manage their organization, invite read-only users, and view data.
Create app/dashboard/page.jsx:
jsx

import { OrganizationSwitcher, OrganizationProfile, UserButton, useOrganization } from '@clerk/nextjs';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function Dashboard() {
  const { organization } = useOrganization();
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  const [newData, setNewData] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    if (organization) {
      fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/data', {
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('clerk-token')}` },
      })
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then(setData);
    }
  }, [organization]);

  const handleCreateData = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const res = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/data', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        Authorization: `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('clerk-token')}`,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ value: newData }),
    });
    if (res.ok) {
      setData([...data, { value: newData }]);
      setNewData('');
    }
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: '20px' }}>
      <UserButton />
      <OrganizationSwitcher />
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <OrganizationProfile />
      <h2>Tenant Data</h2>
      <ul>
        {data.map((item, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{item.value}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <form onSubmit={handleCreateData}>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={newData}
          onChange={(e) => setNewData(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Enter new data"
        />
        <button type="submit">Create Data</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
Explanation:
<UserButton />: Displays the user’s profile and sign-out option.
<OrganizationSwitcher />: Lets users switch between their organizations (tenants).
<OrganizationProfile />: Provides a UI for primary users to invite members and assign roles (e.g., read-only).
The fetch calls retrieve and create tenant data, using Clerk’s session token (manually managed for simplicity; in production, use Clerk’s hooks).
Protect Routes with Middleware:
Create middleware.js to secure routes and redirect unauthenticated users:
js

import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/', '/sign-in(.*)', '/sign-up(.*)']);

export default clerkMiddleware((auth, req) => {
  if (!isPublicRoute(req)) auth().protect();
});

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!.*\\..*|_next).*)', '/', '/(api|trpc)(.*)'],
};
This ensures only authenticated users access the dashboard.

3. Express Backend Setup
The Express backend handles API requests, verifies Clerk JWTs, enforces tenant isolation, and restricts read-only users to read operations. The @clerk/backend SDK simplifies JWT verification and role checking.

Steps
Install Dependencies:
In your Express project, install Clerk’s backend SDK and CORS:
bash

npm install @clerk/backend cors express
Set Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in your Express project root:
env

CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
The Secret Key is used to verify Clerk JWTs.
Set Up Express Server:
Create server.js to handle data APIs with tenant isolation and RBAC:
js

const express = require('express');
const { ClerkExpressWithAuth } = require('@clerk/clerk-sdk-node');
const cors = require('cors');
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const app = express();
app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000' }));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(ClerkExpressWithAuth({ apiKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY }));

// PostgreSQL connection (replace with your DB config)
const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'your_db_user',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'your_db_name',
  password: 'your_db_password',
  port: 5432,
});

// Get tenant data (read-only users allowed)
app.get('/api/data', async (req, res) => {
  const { orgId, orgPermissions } = req.auth;
  if (!orgId) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No organization' });

System: It looks like the Express backend code snippet was cut off. I'll complete the implementation, ensuring it fully addresses your requirements for multi-tenant authentication with read-only users, and provide a comprehensive explanation. Below, I’ll finalize the Express backend setup, include the database schema, and explain how everything ties together for your Next.js + Express app using Clerk’s free plan.

Full Explanation and Implementation (Continued)
Recap of Requirements
Multi-Tenancy: Each tenant (organization) has isolated data, identified by a tenantId (mapped to Clerk’s organizationId).
Primary User: Can create/update/delete tenant data and invite read-only users.
Read-Only Users: Can only view tenant data.
Authentication: Handled by Clerk (email/password, social logins) with pre-built UI.
Authorization: Enforce tenant isolation and role-based access (RBAC) in the Express backend.
Localhost: Works on http://localhost:3000 (Next.js) and http://localhost:5000 (Express).
Free Plan: Use Clerk’s free plan (10,000 MAUs, 100 active organizations).
3. Express Backend Setup (Completed)
The Express backend secures API endpoints, verifies Clerk JWTs, and enforces tenant isolation and RBAC. Below is the complete server.js implementation, including read and write endpoints for tenant data.

Steps (Continued)
Set Up Express Server (Full Implementation):
Create server.js with endpoints for retrieving and creating tenant data, using PostgreSQL for storage (you can swap for another database like MongoDB if preferred).

The code verifies the user’s organization membership, checks permissions, and ensures read-only users can’t modify data.

js

const express = require('express');
const { ClerkExpressWithAuth } = require('@clerk/clerk-sdk-node');
const cors = require('cors');
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const app = express();
app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000' }));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(ClerkExpressWithAuth({ apiKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY }));

// PostgreSQL connection (update with your DB config)
const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'your_db_user',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'your_db_name',
  password: 'your_db_password',
  port: 5432,
});

// Middleware to handle database errors
const query = async (text, params) => {
  try {
    const res = await pool.query(text, params);
    return res;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Database error:', err);
    throw new Error('Database query failed');
  }
};

// Get tenant data (accessible to both admin and read-only)
app.get('/api/data', async (req, res) => {
  const { orgId, orgPermissions } = req.auth;
  if (!orgId) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No organization' });
  if (!orgPermissions.includes('data:read')) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden: Missing read permission' });
  }
  try {
    const result = await query('SELECT id, value FROM data WHERE tenantId = $1', [orgId]);
    res.json(result.rows);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch data' });
  }
});

// Create tenant data (admin only)
app.post('/api/data', async (req, res) => {
  const { orgId, orgPermissions } = req.auth;
  const { value } = req.body;
  if (!orgId) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No organization' });
  if (!orgPermissions.includes('data:write')) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden: Missing write permission' });
  }
  if (!value) return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Value is required' });
  try {
    const id = require('crypto').randomUUID();
    await query('INSERT INTO data (id, tenantId, value) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)', [id, orgId, value]);
    res.json({ message: 'Data created', id, value });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to create data' });
  }
});

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something went wrong' });
});

const PORT = 5000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Backend running on port ${PORT}`));
Explanation:

CORS: Allows requests from http://localhost:3000 (Next.js).
ClerkExpressWithAuth: Verifies Clerk JWTs and populates req.auth with user and organization data (e.g., orgId, orgPermissions).
GET /api/data: Accessible to users with data:read permission (both admin and read-only). Queries data where tenantId matches orgId.
POST /api/data: Restricted to users with data:write permission (admin only). Inserts new data with tenantId = orgId.
Database: Uses PostgreSQL with a data table (schema below). Errors are caught and returned as JSON.
UUID: Generates unique IDs for data entries using Node.js’s crypto module.
Set Up PostgreSQL Database:
Create a database and table to store tenant data:
sql

CREATE DATABASE your_db_name;

\c your_db_name

CREATE TABLE data (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenantId TEXT NOT NULL,
  value TEXT NOT NULL
);
Update the Pool configuration in server.js with your database credentials.
Tenant Isolation: The tenantId column maps to Clerk’s orgId, ensuring users only access their organization’s data.
Install PostgreSQL Driver:
Install the pg package for PostgreSQL:
bash

npm install pg

4. Database Schema
The database stores tenant data with a tenantId to enforce isolation. The schema is simple but extensible.

Schema
sql

CREATE DATABASE your_db_name;

\c your_db_name

CREATE TABLE data (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tenantId TEXT NOT NULL,
  value TEXT NOT NULL
);
id: Unique identifier for each data entry.
tenantId: Maps to Clerk’s organizationId (orgId), ensuring tenant isolation.
value: The data content (e.g., a text field; adjust based on your needs).
You can extend this schema for more complex data (e.g., add createdAt, updatedAt, or other fields).

5. How Clerk Handles Your Requirements
Let’s map each requirement to Clerk’s features and implementation details:

Multi-Tenancy:
Clerk’s Solution: The Organizations feature creates isolated tenants. Each organization has a unique orgId, stored in JWTs and accessible via req.auth.orgId in Express.
Implementation:
Users create organizations via <OrganizationProfile /> or Clerk’s API.
The Express backend queries data with WHERE tenantId = $1 using orgId, ensuring isolation.
Example: SELECT * FROM data WHERE tenantId = $1 only returns data for the user’s current organization.
Primary User:
Clerk’s Solution: Primary users are assigned the admin role with data:read and data:write permissions.
Implementation:
Primary users create organizations and invite members via <OrganizationProfile />.
They can create data via POST /api/data, which checks for data:write permission.
Internal Read-Only Users:
Clerk’s Solution: Invited users are assigned the read-only role with only data:read permission.
Implementation:
Primary users invite read-only users through <OrganizationProfile />, setting their role to read-only.
The Express backend restricts POST /api/data to data:write (admin only), while GET /api/data allows data:read (both roles).
Authentication:
Clerk’s Solution: Pre-built <SignIn /> and <SignUp /> components handle email/password and social logins (e.g., Google, GitHub).
Implementation:
Users sign in/up at /sign-in and /sign-up pages.
Clerk generates JWTs with user and organization data, automatically passed to Express via Authorization headers.
Authorization:
Clerk’s Solution: Custom roles (admin, read-only) and permissions (data:read, data:write) are stored in JWTs and verified by @clerk/backend.
Implementation:
Express checks req.auth.orgPermissions to enforce RBAC.
Tenant isolation is enforced by matching req.auth.orgId with tenantId in database queries.
Localhost Development:
Clerk’s Solution: Clerk supports localhost by adding http://localhost:3000 to Allowed Origins.
Implementation:
Configure Allowed Origins in the Clerk Dashboard.
Ensure CORS in Express allows http://localhost:3000.
6. Testing the Solution
Follow these steps to test your multi-tenant app with read-only users on localhost:

Setup
Clerk Dashboard:
Create an application, enable Organizations, and configure roles (admin, read-only) and permissions (data:read, data:write).
Add http://localhost:3000 to Allowed Origins.
Set sign-in/sign-up URLs to /sign-in and /sign-up.
Next.js:
Install @clerk/nextjs and set up .env.local with your Publishable Key and Secret Key.
Implement app/layout.jsx, app/sign-in/page.jsx, app/sign-up/page.jsx, and app/dashboard/page.jsx as shown.
Add middleware.js to protect routes.
Express:
Install @clerk/backend, cors, express, and pg.
Set up .env with your Secret Key and database credentials.
Implement server.js as shown.
Create the PostgreSQL database and data table.
Run the App:
Start PostgreSQL (e.g., via pg_ctl or Docker).
Run Express: node server.js (on http://localhost:5000).
Run Next.js: npm run dev (on http://localhost:3000).
Test Scenarios
Primary User Flow:
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/sign-up and create an account.
After signing up, you’re redirected to /dashboard.
Use <OrganizationProfile /> to create an organization and set your role to admin.
Add data via the form on /dashboard (calls POST /api/data).
Verify the data appears in the list (calls GET /api/data).
Invite a read-only user via <OrganizationProfile /> (enter their email, assign read-only role).
Read-Only User Flow:
The invited user receives an email (check Clerk Dashboard or your email provider).
They sign up or sign in at http://localhost:3000/sign-in.
On /dashboard, they see the organization’s data (via GET /api/data).
Attempt to create data (via POST /api/data). It should fail with a 403 error (“Forbidden: Missing write permission”).
Tenant Isolation:
Create a second organization as the primary user.
Switch between organizations using <OrganizationSwitcher />.
Verify that GET /api/data only returns data for the active organization (based on orgId).
Authentication:
Test social login (e.g., Google) if enabled.
Sign out and back in to ensure sessions work correctly.
Error Handling:
Try accessing /dashboard without signing in (should redirect to /sign-in).
Test invalid API requests (e.g., missing value in POST /api/data) to ensure proper error responses.
7. Handling Clerk’s Free Plan Limitations
Clerk’s free plan is sufficient for your use case, but here’s how to manage its limitations:

10,000 MAUs: Tracks users who sign in during a month. For development or small apps, this is ample. Monitor usage in the Clerk Dashboard.
100 Active Organizations: Each organization (tenant) counts if it has active users. This supports up to 100 tenants, suitable for most early-stage apps.
Branding: Clerk’s logo appears on <SignIn /> and <SignUp /> components. This is fine for development but may require a paid plan ($25/month) for production to remove.
No SMS Auth: Use email/password or social logins (included in free plan). Magic links provide a passwordless alternative.
Refresh Tokens: Some users report issues with refresh tokens in the free plan. Test session persistence in your app (e.g., after browser refresh). If problematic, Clerk’s paid plan or custom session handling may be needed.
8. Common Issues and Solutions
CORS Errors:
Ensure Express allows http://localhost:3000 via cors middleware.
Verify http://localhost:3000 is in Clerk’s Allowed Origins.
JWT Verification:
If req.auth is empty, check that CLERK_SECRET_KEY is correct in Express’s .env.
Ensure the Next.js frontend sends the Clerk JWT in the Authorization header.
Session Token Access:
The dashboard example uses localStorage.getItem('clerk-token') for simplicity. In production, use Clerk’s getToken() hook:
jsx

import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs';
const { getToken } = useAuth();
const token = await getToken();
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/data', { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } });
Database Connection:
Update pool config with your PostgreSQL credentials.
Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible.
Social Login Redirects:
For OAuth (e.g., Google), configure redirect URLs in the provider’s console (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
If testing externally, use ngrok http 3000 to expose localhost and update Clerk’s Allowed Origins.
9. Scaling to Production
When moving from localhost to production:

HTTPS: Update Allowed Origins to your production domain (e.g., https://yourapp.com).
Database: Use a managed PostgreSQL service (e.g., Supabase, AWS RDS).
Environment Variables: Securely store Clerk keys in your hosting platform (e.g., Vercel for Next.js, Heroku for Express).
MAU Monitoring: Track usage in the Clerk Dashboard. Upgrade to a paid plan if you exceed 10,000 MAUs or 100 orgs.
Branding: Consider the $25/month plan to remove Clerk branding for a professional look.
Webhooks: Use Clerk’s webhooks (free plan) to sync user/organization data with your backend (e.g., create tenantId records on organization creation).
10. Why This is the Simplest Approach
Compared to alternatives (NextAuth.js, Firebase, Passport.js, or custom auth):

Pre-Built Features: Clerk’s Organizations, roles, and UI components eliminate the need to build tenant management or auth forms.
Managed Security: Clerk handles password hashing, JWT issuance, and compliance (SOC 2 Type 2), reducing security risks.
Free Plan Sufficiency: Supports your entire use case without upfront costs.
Minimal Code: The Next.js frontend uses Clerk’s components, and the Express backend only needs simple permission checks.
Localhost Ease: Quick setup with localhost support.
11. Next Steps
Implement the Code:
Use the provided artifacts (dashboard/page.jsx, server.js) and earlier snippets (layout.jsx, sign-in/page.jsx, sign-up/page.jsx, middleware.js).
Set up PostgreSQL and configure the database schema.
Configure Clerk in the Dashboard as described.
Test Thoroughly:
Follow the test scenarios to verify multi-tenancy, read-only access, and authentication.
Check Clerk’s Activity Logs in the Dashboard for debugging.
Enhance as Needed:
Add more data fields to the data table.
Customize <OrganizationProfile /> appearance via Clerk’s theming options.
Implement additional auth methods (e.g., Google OAuth) if required.
Monitor and Plan:
Track MAUs and orgs in the Clerk Dashboard.
Budget for a paid plan if your app scales beyond free plan limits.
