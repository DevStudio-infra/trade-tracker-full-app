Backend Functionalities to Move to a Node.js Server
Based on the provided code, these are the API endpoints and functionalities that seem suitable to be moved to a separate Node.js server:

1. User Management APIs:
   client/app/api/user/route.ts (DELETE - User Deletion):
   This endpoint handles the deletion of a user account. It directly interacts with the Prisma database.
   client/app/api/user/accept-terms/route.ts (POST - Accept Terms of Service):
   Updates user's terms and privacy acceptance status in the database.
   client/app/api/user/accept-privacy/route.ts (POST - Accept Privacy Policy):
   Updates user's privacy policy acceptance status.
   client/app/api/user/welcome-seen/route.ts (POST - Mark Welcome Message as Seen):
   Updates user's hasSeenWelcome status.
   client/actions/update-user-role.ts (Server Action - Update User Role):
   Updates a user's role in the database. This is currently a server action, but the core logic is backend-related.
   client/actions/update-user-name.ts (Server Action - Update User Name):
   Updates a user's name in the database. Similar to the role update, this is backend logic.
2. Session Management APIs:
   client/app/api/sessions/route.ts (GET & POST - Session Retrieval and Creation):
   Handles fetching user sessions and creating new analysis sessions. Interacts with the analysisSession table in the database.
   client/app/api/sessions/[id]/route.ts (DELETE - Session Deletion):
   Deletes a specific analysis session.
3. Credit Management APIs:
   client/app/api/credits/[userId]/balance/route.ts (GET - Get Credit Balance):
   Retrieves and calculates the user's credit balance, considering subscription status and monthly usage.
   client/app/api/credits/[userId]/use/route.ts (POST - Use Credits):
   Handles deducting credits from a user's balance and creating a transaction record.
   client/app/api/credits/[userId]/history/route.ts (GET - Get Credit History):
   Fetches the transaction history for a user's credits.
   client/app/api/credits/[userId]/purchase/route.ts (POST - Purchase Credits - Stripe Integration):
   Handles the initiation of credit purchases, including validation and Stripe price ID retrieval. While it initiates Stripe, the actual Stripe webhook handling and transaction completion might be elsewhere (not shown in these snippets).
4. Feedback API:
   client/app/api/feedback/route.ts (POST - Record RAG Feedback):
   Records user feedback related to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
5. Potentially Monthly Credit Refresh Logic:
   While not explicitly an API route, the logic for monthly credit refresh (mentioned in MONTHLY-CREDITS-TODO.md) would likely reside on the backend server. This would involve scheduled tasks to update user credits.

   Thoughts on the Current Authentication System
   The current authentication system, using NextAuth.js, is generally well-structured and robust for a Next.js application. Here are my thoughts:
   Pros of the Current System:
   Tight Integration with Next.js: NextAuth.js is designed for Next.js, providing seamless integration with server components, API routes, and middleware. This is evident in the provided code (e.g., auth.ts, middleware.ts, API routes using auth()).
   Server-Side Rendering & Security: NextAuth.js handles authentication server-side, which is generally more secure than client-side authentication, especially for sensitive operations.
   Flexibility and Features: It supports various providers (Google, Email/Passwordless via Resend in this case), session management (JWT strategy is used), callbacks for customization (like session and JWT manipulation in auth.ts), and middleware for route protection.
   Well-Documented and Community Supported: NextAuth.js is a popular library with good documentation and a strong community, making it easier to find solutions and support.
   Considerations for a Separate Backend Server:
   API Authentication: When you move backend logic to a separate Node.js server, you'll need to authenticate API requests coming from the Next.js frontend to this backend.
   Session Management Across Servers: You'll need to decide how sessions will be managed between the frontend and backend. Options include:
   JWTs: The current JWT strategy in NextAuth.js can be adapted. The frontend can send the JWT in the Authorization header for backend API requests. The backend server would need to verify these JWTs.
   Session Cookies (with adjustments): If you prefer session cookies, you'll need to ensure they are correctly set and shared between the frontend and backend domains (potentially involving CORS and sameSite: 'none'; secure: true cookie settings if domains are different).
   Potential Redundancy: If you move authentication logic entirely to the backend, you might end up duplicating some of the authentication handling that NextAuth.js already provides in the frontend.
   Recommendation for Authentication:
   Keep NextAuth.js in the Next.js frontend for user authentication and session initiation. It's already well-integrated and handles the initial authentication flow (sign-in, sign-up, session management in the browser) effectively.
   For backend API authentication, leverage JWTs generated by NextAuth.js. Here's a possible approach:
   Frontend Authentication (NextAuth.js): User logs in via NextAuth.js in the Next.js frontend. NextAuth.js generates a JWT upon successful authentication and stores it (e.g., in a cookie or in-memory).
   Frontend API Requests: When the frontend needs to make a request to the new Node.js backend server, it includes the JWT in the Authorization header of the HTTP request (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <JWT>).
   Backend JWT Verification (Node.js Server): The Node.js backend server will need middleware to:
   Extract the JWT from the Authorization header.
   Verify the JWT's signature using the same AUTH_SECRET (or a secure key exchange mechanism if you want to keep secrets separate).
   Optionally, validate other claims in the JWT (e.g., expiration, user ID).
   If the JWT is valid, allow the request to proceed to the API endpoint handler. Otherwise, return an authentication error (401 Unauthorized).
   Benefits of this approach:
   Reuses Existing Auth System: You don't need to completely rewrite authentication logic. NextAuth.js handles the user-facing authentication flow.
   Stateless Backend: JWTs allow your backend to be stateless, as each request carries the authentication information within the token itself.
   Scalability: JWT-based authentication is generally scalable.
   Security: JWTs, when properly implemented and verified, provide a secure way to authenticate API requests.
   To implement this, you would need to:
   Backend (Node.js/Express):
   Install a JWT verification library (e.g., jsonwebtoken for Node.js).
   Create middleware to verify JWTs in incoming requests.
   Ensure the backend has access to the AUTH_SECRET to verify JWT signatures securely (consider environment variables or secure configuration management).
   Frontend (Next.js):
   When making API calls to the backend, retrieve the JWT from the NextAuth.js session (you can access it via getSession or useSession hooks).
   Add the JWT to the Authorization header of your fetch or axios requests.
   This approach allows you to leverage the strengths of NextAuth.js for frontend authentication while securely authenticating API requests to your new backend server using JWTs.

Credit Management (Balance, Use, History, Purchase):
Directly related to core business logic: Credits are likely tied to monetization and usage limits of your application. Managing them efficiently and securely is paramount.
Database intensive: These APIs heavily interact with the database to read and update credit balances and transaction history. Offloading this from the Next.js frontend can improve performance and reduce load on the frontend server, especially if credit usage is frequent.
Potential Security Implications: Managing financial transactions (even initiating them like in the purchase API) and credit balances is sensitive. A dedicated backend can provide a more secure environment to handle these operations, separating them from the user-facing frontend.
Scalability: As your user base grows and credit usage increases, having a dedicated backend to handle credit management will be crucial for scalability and performance.
Monthly Credit Refresh Logic:
Purely Backend Task: This is a scheduled task that needs to run independently of user interactions and the frontend application. It's a classic backend responsibility.
Essential for Credit System Functionality: Without this logic, the monthly credit system (as described in MONTHLY-CREDITS-TODO.md) won't work. Users won't get their monthly credits, breaking a core feature.
Reliability and Scheduling: Backend servers are better suited for running scheduled tasks reliably. You can use tools like cron jobs or task schedulers within the Node.js environment to ensure this logic runs as expected.
Why other functionalities are less immediately crucial (but still important to consider moving later):
User Management APIs (Delete User, Accept Terms/Privacy, Welcome Seen, Update Role/Name): While these are backend operations (database updates), they are generally less frequent and less performance-critical than credit management. User deletion, terms acceptance, and welcome messages happen relatively infrequently compared to credit usage. Updating roles and names are also less performance-sensitive. These can be moved later, although they are still good candidates for backend migration.
Session Management APIs (Get Sessions, Create Session, Delete Session): Session management is important, but if you are keeping NextAuth.js in the frontend for authentication, the session initiation and management are already handled there. Moving these APIs to the backend might be beneficial later for better separation of concerns and potentially for more complex session management logic in the future, but it's not as immediately crucial as credit management.
Feedback API (Record RAG Feedback): Recording feedback is a backend operation (database write), but it's likely less performance-critical and less sensitive than credit management. It can be moved to the backend, but it's not as urgent as the credit-related functionalities.
In summary, prioritize moving Credit Management APIs and the Monthly Credit Refresh Logic to your Node.js server first. These are the most critical for your application's business logic, performance, and scalability. You can then progressively migrate User Management, Session Management, and Feedback APIs in subsequent phases.
