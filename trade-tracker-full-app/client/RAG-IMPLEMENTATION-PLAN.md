# RAG Implementation Plan for Trading Analysis Assistant

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system to enhance our trading analysis AI assistant using Google's Gemini AI. The system will augment the LLM's responses with specialized trading knowledge, psychological insights, and contextual awareness while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

## Core Components

### 1. Knowledge Base Structure

- Trading Technical Analysis
- Trading Psychology
- Risk Management
- Market Patterns & Probabilities
- Common Trading Scenarios
- Emotional Response Handling

## Gemini AI Integration Details

### Embedding Generation

```yaml
model: "embedding-001" # Gemini's embedding model
dimension: 768
batch_size: 100 # Optimal batch size for cost efficiency
rate_limit: 60 # Requests per minute
```

### Text Generation

```yaml
model: "gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05" # Currently used in analyze/route.ts
features:
  - Structured output
  - Multi-modal capabilities
  - Low latency responses
cost_optimization:
  - Implement caching for frequent queries
  - Use chunking for optimal token usage
  - Batch similar requests when possible
```

### Vector Database Implementation

```yaml
selected_db: "Supabase with pgvector"
advantages:
  - Already integrated with existing infrastructure
  - Native PostgreSQL vector operations
  - Cost-effective (included in existing Supabase instance)
  - Built-in indexing and similarity search
  - Scalable and production-ready
implementation_details:
  table_structure:
    name: "trading_knowledge_embeddings"
    columns:
      - id: uuid (primary key)
      - content: text (original content)
      - embedding: vector(768) # Matches Gemini's embedding dimension
      - metadata: jsonb (additional context and tags)
      - created_at: timestamp
      - updated_at: timestamp
  indexes:
    - type: "ivfflat"
      column: "embedding vector_cosine_ops"
      lists: 100 # Optimized for our dataset size
```

## TODO List

### Phase 1: Knowledge Base Setup [ ]

- [ ] Create vector database structure (using Chroma or similar open-source solution)
- [ ] Design schema for document chunks optimized for Gemini's context window
- [ ] Set up embeddings pipeline using Gemini's embedding-001 model
- [ ] Implement document preprocessing pipeline
  - Document chunking (optimized for Gemini's token limits)
  - Metadata extraction
  - Vector embedding generation with batching

### Phase 2: Initial Knowledge Seeding [ ]

- [ ] Create seed documents for:
  - [ ] Common chart patterns with probability data
  - [ ] Support/Resistance identification guidelines
  - [ ] Trend analysis frameworks
  - [ ] Trading psychology scenarios
  - [ ] Risk management rules
  - [ ] Position sizing strategies
  - [ ] Market condition identification

### Phase 3: RAG Integration [ ]

- [ ] Implement vector similarity search
- [ ] Create prompt engineering pipeline
- [ ] Develop context injection system
- [ ] Set up response augmentation logic
- [ ] Implement relevance scoring

### Phase 4: API Integration [ ]

- [ ] Extend existing analyze/route.ts Gemini integration to include RAG pipeline
- [ ] Implement efficient prompt construction using Gemini's structured input format
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and error handling for Gemini API calls
- [ ] Add token usage tracking and optimization

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization [ ]

- [ ] Create test suite for RAG responses
- [ ] Implement feedback loop mechanism
- [ ] Optimize retrieval performance
- [ ] Fine-tune relevance thresholds

## Initial Knowledge Base Seeds (Examples)

### Chart Patterns

```yaml
pattern: "Double Bottom"
probability_success: 72%
timeframe_effectiveness: ["Daily", "4H"]
volume_confirmation: "Required"
description: "A W-shaped reversal pattern indicating potential trend change"
psychological_aspects:
  - "Tests trader patience during second bottom"
  - "Common panic selling at second bottom creates opportunity"
risk_management:
  - "Stop loss below second bottom"
  - "Position sizing: 1-2% risk per trade"
```

### Trading Psychology Scenarios

```yaml
scenario: "Breaking Even Exit"
emotional_trigger: "Fear of losing profits"
common_mistakes:
  - "Exiting too early"
  - "Ignoring original trade plan"
mitigation_strategies:
  - "Set mechanical take-profit levels"
  - "Use trailing stops instead of manual exits"
success_rate_improvement: "35% increase in profit factor"
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

- Implement aggressive caching for frequent queries
- Use batch processing for embeddings generation
- Optimize chunk sizes for Gemini's pricing model
- Monitor and adjust rate limits based on usage patterns
- Implement token usage tracking and optimization
- Use streaming responses when appropriate

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1 implementation
2. Create detailed technical specifications for each component
3. Set up development environment with necessary dependencies
4. Start knowledge base seeding with most critical patterns

## Notes

- Consider implementing feedback collection from users
- Plan for regular updates to knowledge base
- Monitor response quality and latency
- Consider A/B testing different knowledge structures
