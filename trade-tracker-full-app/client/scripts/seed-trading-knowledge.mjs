    A double bottom is a bullish reversal pattern that forms after a downtrend.
    It consists of two lows at approximately the same price level, creating a "W" shape.
    Key characteristics include:
    1. Similar price levels at both bottoms
    2. Volume typically higher on second bottom
    3. Confirmation when price breaks above the middle peak`,
