metadata: {
  success_rate: number,          // Statistical success rate
  timeframes: string[],          // Optimal timeframes
  volume_importance: string,     // Critical/High/Medium/Low
  risk_ratio: number,           // Reward-to-risk ratio
  confirmation_indicators: string[], // Additional confirmation tools
  failure_points: string[],      // Common failure scenarios
  target_calculation: string,    // How to calculate targets
  stop_loss_rules: string[]     // Stop loss placement rules
}
```

## 5. Implementation Template

### Pattern Structure Template

```typescript
{
  content: `Pattern Name:
    Description and background

    Key characteristics:
    1. Formation requirements
    2. Confirmation criteria
    3. Volume considerations

    Entry Rules:
    - Entry point details
    - Confirmation requirements
    - Volume confirmation

    Exit Rules:
    - Profit targets
    - Stop loss placement
    - Position management

    Risk Management:

  }
}
```

## 6. Testing and Validation Checklist

### Pattern Testing

- [ ] Create test queries for each pattern
- [ ] Verify embedding generation
- [ ] Test pattern retrieval
- [ ] Validate metadata consistency

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Test pattern relationships
- [ ] Verify category grouping
- [ ] Test tag-based searches
- [ ] Validate cross-pattern references

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Test embedding generation speed
- [ ] Verify search response times
- [ ] Test multiple pattern retrievals
- [ ] Validate database performance

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Bullish Reversal Patterns implementation
2. Create and test each pattern individually
3. Implement Bearish Reversal Patterns
4. Add Continuation Patterns
5. Perform comprehensive testing
6. Document any pattern-specific considerations

## Notes

- Each pattern should include real-world examples
- Include common variations of each pattern
- Add failure scenarios and warning signs
- Include risk management guidelines
- Reference related patterns and setups
