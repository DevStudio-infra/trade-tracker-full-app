# Database Operations Migration Tracking

This file tracks the migration of database operations from client-side to server-side.

## Client Actions to Migrate

### User Management

- [x] `update-user-name.ts`

  - ~~Current: Direct Prisma call to update user name~~
  - ~~TODO: Create server endpoint and update client to use it~~
  - Completed: Server endpoint created at `/api/users/:userId/name`
  - Completed: Client updated to use server endpoint

- [x] `update-user-role.ts`
  - ~~Current: Direct Prisma call to update user role~~
  - ~~TODO: Create server endpoint and update client to use it~~
  - Completed: Server endpoint created at `/api/users/:userId/role`
  - Completed: Client updated to use server endpoint

### Stripe Integration

- [x] `generate-user-stripe.ts`

  - ~~Current: Creates Stripe sessions~~
  - ~~TODO: Move Stripe session creation to server~~
  - Completed: Server endpoint created at `/api/stripe/session`
  - Completed: Client updated to use server endpoint

- [x] `open-customer-portal.ts`
  - ~~Current: Creates Stripe portal sessions~~
  - ~~TODO: Move Stripe portal session creation to server~~
  - Completed: Functionality merged into `/api/stripe/session` endpoint
  - Note: Separate endpoint not needed as portal session creation is handled by the same endpoint

## Migration Steps for Each Action

1. Create corresponding server endpoint
2. Update client action to use new endpoint
3. Test the migration
4. Remove Prisma dependencies from client action
5. Mark as completed

## Additional Tasks

- [x] Remove Prisma Client from client-side dependencies

  - Removed @prisma/client
  - Removed prisma dev dependency
  - Updated postinstall script

- [x] Update environment variables to remove database connection from client

  - Created new .env.example without database variables
  - Removed DATABASE_URL and related variables from client

- [x] Update documentation to reflect new architecture

  - Added API endpoints documentation in this file
  - Updated environment variable documentation

- [x] Add proper error handling for API calls

  - Added error handling in client actions
  - Added proper HTTP status codes in server endpoints
  - Added error logging

- [x] Add request validation on server endpoints
  - Added Zod schemas for request validation
  - Added validateRequest middleware
  - Implemented validation for all endpoints

## Completed Migrations

All migrations have been completed. The application now follows a proper client-server architecture with:

- Server-side database operations
- Proper request validation
- Error handling
- Clean separation of concerns
- Secure environment configuration
